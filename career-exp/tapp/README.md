# Career Experience Token App
Welcome to the Career Experience Token App! This innovative platform allows you to tokenize your work experience, share your achievements, and receive endorsements from colleagues. Here's how to get started and make the most of this powerful tool.

1. Obtain Employer Information
Before you can claim your career experience token, you'll need to gather some important information:

- Employer Name: The official name of the company you worked for.
- Employment Certificate: An official document from your employer that verifies your employment. This serves as proof of your work experience.
ðŸ”‘ Tip: Reach out to your company's HR department if you need help obtaining these documents. (For now only Smart Token Labs is registered as a employer)

2. Claim Your Career Experience Token
Once you have the necessary information, you're ready to mint your career experience token:

- Open any Career Experience Token Tapp. (e.g. https://x.com/JiaFeng22126229/status/1851871308084121907)
- Navigate to the "Claim" section.
- Enter the required information:
  - Select your employer from the dropdown list.
  - Paste the cryptographic proof from your employment certificate.
- Review the information for accuracy.
- Click the "Claim" button.
- Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You've now minted your career experience token.

3. Share and Collect Endorsements
Your career token is more than just a digital certificate - it's a living record of your professional journey:

  1. Share your token:

    - Use the "Share on Twitter" button to share your career experience token on Twitter (Due to some limitation, you will need to copy the url and open in browser manually)

  2. Collect endorsements:

    - Colleagues who also hold tokens from the same employer can endorse your token.
For an endorsement to be valid, the endorser must have worked at the company during an overlapping period with you.

ðŸ’¡ Note: Endorsements add credibility to your career token and strengthen your professional network.

4. Leverage Your Token for Future Opportunities
Your career experience token becomes a powerful asset in your professional toolkit:

- Verified Experience: The token serves as blockchain-verified proof of your work history.
- Endorsements: Collected endorsements act as on-chain recommendations from colleagues.
- Easy Sharing: Quickly share your verified experience with potential employers or clients.

ðŸš€ Pro Tip: As you accumulate more career tokens and endorsements, you're building a trustworthy, decentralized resume that can open doors to new opportunities.

Remember
- Keep your employment certificates safe, as you'll need them to claim tokens on behalf of your working experience
